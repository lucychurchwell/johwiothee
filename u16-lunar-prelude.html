The format is "band name - album title (if known) - release date (if known) - recording status/any other notes". I've marked out things that are related projects or similar genres that might be of interest with a (+) sign.

Include The name of the shoe, release date, price, where they will be sold, a picture, a link and/or any other information If you missed it, last week's thread may be found here (https://redd.it/be1mh7). The following were the most popular releases of last week (April 3rd): Avengers: No Road Home #10 (https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/be1mh7/new_marvel_comics_and_releases_for_april_17th/el2geun/) Spider-Man: Life Story #2 (https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/be1mh7/new_marvel_comics_and_releases_for_april_17th/el2h2vj/) War of the Realms #2 (https://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/. In honor of the FFIV banner and event, here is an orchestral arrangement I made a few months back for a friend. The Final Fantasies - IV (https://soundcloud.com/user-84652585/the-final-fantasies-iv) The tale behind the arrangement is a sad one. The one for whom I made this track had been ailing for a while, and I knew it would only be a matter of time before he succumbed to the illness. I had promised to make him a symphonic fantasy based on his favorite SNES Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy.

Not specified, will be main story related regardless. Main Story Soul Searching Alisaie The Rising Stones (https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/The_Rising_Stones) (X:6.1. Hello. My name is Michael Lowder, and I found this subreddit (and subbed) in hopes of not being alone anymore. Not a lot of my peers know who I am, and i dont want them to, so allow me to share who I am on here I live in the Alabama, US and I have Aspergers, ADHD, Tourettes, and Learning Disability Not Otherwise Specified. I am 18 and am a freshman in college pursuing a degree in Piano Performance. What I do: I am a very musical person; I play piano and violin. I've been playing piano since. #Forward Hi guys, TastyGherkin aka Mr. Moonlight here again. This time I wanted to do something different with Mythgard’s lore. Instead of trying to breakdown and understand the lore, I wanted to speculate what the unknowns of Mythgard’s lore are. What follows is my imagining of Mythgard’s history and world – essentially fanfiction, or a really complicated fan theory in semi-narrative form! While I have tried to match both the known lore and real world mythology as best as possible, I ultimatel. 
Correct me if I'm wrong but doesn't Exaltation usually burn off things like Wyld mutations? Or if I start them as a beast man does that not burn off? I was hoping to do some preludes and I'd like to have them exalt presumably that one into a Lunar although I guess if they can stay a cat person maybe a solar. I was hoping you all might have some suggestions on how to introduce them to Creation without overwhelming them. I think for what ever I run with this group I would need to run mostly Solars and maybe a Lunar to appease the one person who really wants to play a cat person. The bright side would be said cat person is married to one of the other folks anyway so I can have that solar bond going to try and make it a bit easier. Based on what I have I was leaning towards 2nd Ed since EDIT: NOTICE: Since the JP Relic draw threads really don't get too many posts on here (I think most of our community uses there more for forward information) if you want to post your JP draw for an event feel free to do so here on the Megathread as there won't be separate relic draw pages going forward. So a huge collab since JP loves Dragon Quest. I only played the original years ago on my NES but it was a really good game and I've heard the series has only gotten better. Overall Seeing how the MC Event rewards aren't that amazing in the scheme of things, I am no longer updating this list. However, key things to note: -Each day only has 3 sets of questions, same order of the same questions in each set -Some questions are repeats from previous days -If someone is spamming in caps on NA East, it's probably me on my 10th OX Quiz of the day xD LAST UPDATED: 10/2/18 -- 9:45PM EST/6:45PM PST amp#x200B; Can we compile an updated master I have these games for trade Rapture Rejects, Darkside Detective, Wuppo, GRID 2, Layers of Fear, Forts, Interplanetary: Enhanced Edition, Bear With Me - Collector's Edition, AER Memories of Old, The Norwood Suite, Higurashi When They Cry Hou - Ch.1 Onikakushi, Galactic Civilizations® III, Saints Row 2, DreadOut, DreadOut: Keepers of The Dark, HackyZack, Steamworld Heist, A Story About My Uncle, Brigador: Up-Armored Edition, Hacknet, No Time to Explain, VVVVVV, 2064: Read Only Memories, A Virus. </p>
