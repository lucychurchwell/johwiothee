                            <p> So for those who are still not aware of stash transferring bug after patch 1.0.4.0, it is a good idea to stop using GDIA for now. However, you can still use it if you want, but you need to follow the instructions provided in the official GDIA thread, or you might lose your items during the transfer. (I lost my Spellscourge set during the transfer) Crate is working on a hotfix right now. Hopefully it comes out before Christ. Is this possible with hamachi? if anyone in here has any knowledge about how one would set this up, it would be greatly appreciated. The servers are off for maintenance. Once the servers get back up we'll be able to download the patch. The maintenance is expected to be 3 hours long. amp#x200B; Keep in mind that this is a google translation and it might not be 100% correct. amp#x200B; Additions: 1. New UI interface in the battle 2. New double tap operation, they're removing the zoom on double tap (thank god) 3. New daily winning awards (the first top 4 finish of the day will award 5 extra candies) 4. New report system. Hi folks, Yay, this has been merged and is part of 4.0! QEMU 4.0 is due soon, and there was a big change to configuration of the audio backend, which is now done the same way as all other configuration, via the `-audiodev` parameter. I took some time to revamp/improve the second part of my qemu audio patches, and if all goes well, they will be part of 4.0. This has already been tested on my machine and another, and we both have very few crackles and superb latency. I am looking for people. will the patch be added on the maintenance? or is it just a regular maintenance cause i really really want to see the patch notes. I have \~150 hours in-game. Part of me really misses flying in my Javelin, the other part is hesitant about buying the game outright. Reasons for not buying the game: - EA has a history of killing games (and this one has worse reviews than ME:Andromeda) - It was shipped as an unfinished game and I don't want to reward that (on principle I uninstalled a day or two before EA Access expired) - Loot was in a bad state when I left - All other exhaustive issues with the game Reasons for buyin. I've already seen posts that HoR is still nothing but the monitor fight, and I've already been kicked out of a game for server issues, so what did they actually do? Did they make any changes that everyone's been asking for or improve their servers at all? Really hoping for some good changes before April. 
sorry if this has been pointed out but. Downtime? (https://imgur.com/a/2omzzgg). Okay. it took me forever to learn how, but I finally made an eboot based on Sakitoshi's Hack of Mega Man X3 (https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/4104/). I made it look as close to a standard Emuparadise PSX2PSP ISO as possible. Hope you all like it, enjoy~ :) Mega Man X3 (USA) with PSX cover art: MediaFire ( Mega Man X3 (USA) with SNES cover art: MediaFire (http://www.mediafire.com/file/uiiv55cu3y75kcw/Meg. hi guys,this year's 2019 releases are all pretty hectic and unstable patches, so please share your experience with the new 4.0.8 patch (bundled with the new lightroom 8.1 release), maybe we can help each other out for me nothing can open when offline, and home screens in after effects and premiere closes immediately, even if i click the home button on and on ( https://streamable.com/elek6 (https://streamable.com/elek6) ) I'm personally thinking about installing 2018 again It has been 10 years since GTA IV has been released. I am unable to play the game currently on my PC due to compatibility issues. I want a 10th anniversary and remastered edition of GTA IV and its episodes, for the Nintendo Switch. GTA needs a new Nintendo game. After GTA 1 amp 2 on the GBC, GTA Advance on the GBA and GTA CW on the DS and none on the 3DS; I am waiting for a GTA Switch. It will be cool to hear Roman asking Niko to go bowling on my Switch outside of my own home, please Rockstar. Found this out through lots of trial and error and it may apply to other HDMI switchers as well.if you've tried to run PSVR in an HDMI switch box setup in which you want to have multiple sources play on the PSVR.you will likely have had issues.HDMI (meaning PS4 signal) not detected, please connect HDMI warning message, etc. BUT there is a simple solution that many won't discover on their own for the simple fact that most people will want the PS4/PS4 Pro on either Source 1 or 2 - because. 
Last year, or lets say in pretty much all recent events the community had something to work on togheter. Now we have a few giveaways and a random tournament. But lets say you are not one of the few winners: What is there for you? A 2 x BP weekend one month after the anniversary itself. Edit: We have something new now - you can buy some sick dbd kicks. Latest Update: 30/12/2017 Added Devil's Third complete cache Files are operational for v 1.8.0-1.11.3 gt All files are compressed for your convenience, so use 7zip ( or Winrar ( to Extract them. This caches are based off my spreadsheet which you can find here (also contains mirrors) :https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S05wt1T4AkZu3qrtU2iE76unfB4Xb5Y8CHnz2f3PoYA/ #Completed Caches Download Shader Count. I'd like to play Requiem again now, but I'm unsure which path to take. Essentially, I think it boils down to me having 3 options: 1: Wait for the Ultimate Skyrim beta Pros: It's a large, highly curated mod list I know from experience with 3.4 it's very well done Cons: Beta is 2 weeks away Even after that, it's likely to see frequent updates to patch/change things, which means I'll need to do lots of extra legwork (even with MO) 2: Play Requiem 2.02 on Classic Pros:. 
UPDATE TWO: A new beta update has been added, version 1.0.33.0. Please find the list of updates in the newest version of the beta update: Fixed a crash that can occur when using the Transfer or Workshop menu Set default application supersampling value to 1.0. -- To change this value up or down to adjust performance or quality, add the following to your Fallout4Custom.ini in My Games/Fallout4VR: VRDisplay fRenderTargetSizeMultiplier=ltyour valuegt. Good time of the day for everybody! After almost 2 years I've got myself a new rig to play, a modest one and a nice screen. So, what has happened to 1.9.3? Is it 2.0 worth? What new mods are available? Do we already have dragonborn integrated? Im looking forward to first run 1.9.4 alone, and maybe try 2.0 alone. Is it possible to upgrade from 1.9.3? Hope to read y'all. Will there be a 3.6? a 4.0? or straight to beta? or does nobody. </p>
